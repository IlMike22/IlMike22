Hi, Iâ€™m Michael ðŸ‘‹

IÂ´m a passionate Android developer. I love to learn new things and to use them in new projects.
I`m interested in Android app development with Kotlin. 

What I use when I code:
- clean architecure with MVVM
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Dependency Injection with Dagger Hilt and Koin, 
- writing unit tests with jUnit and Mockito 
- Databinding
- LiveData
- Room, Retrofit, OkHttp, Picasso

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Jetpack Compose and Navigation. I also take a deeper look into RxJava and Dagger2. And starting to look on KMM :-)
